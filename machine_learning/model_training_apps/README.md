# Data Analysis Streamlit apps

Streamlit apps for easily train models are sourced here.
To install Streamlit simply use pip:

```
pip install streamlit
```

To interact with the apps, access the folder where they are located (i.e. /qoe_model/, etc.) and execute the following command line:

```
streamlit run main.py
```

A Streamlit server should be launched:

```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.0.237:8501
```

It should also automatically open your default browser so that you can visualize the results.

Once a model is trained, it goes to the machine_learning/output/models folder in the project, where it can be zipped and upoloaded to a public URL for later use.
